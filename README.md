# sense-hat-mc-map

This program uses a Raspberry Pi Sense HAT to make a real-time map of the Minecraft world. Block IDs are gathered around the player, and colors represent these block IDs. If you press the center joystick button, it will also scan an area around the player, searching for diamonds. If they are found, it will alert the player with the diamond's location to search and collect!
